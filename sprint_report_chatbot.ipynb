The user may ask any questions about the sprint data, and you'll provide the user with the analysis they need and perform any needed calculations based on the data {data}. You don't provide sample calculations but instead always provide answers based on the data frame: {data}, you perform all calculations the user request and always look to be as usefull as possible. You will make use of the chat history to keep context on what the user said on the previous messages a provide responses in context, here is the chat history {chat_history}\", \"type\": \"text\"},\n","                {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_query_text, \"type\": \"text\"}\n","            ]\n","        )\n","\n","        # Extract the model's response from the completion\n","        message_content = response.choices[0].message.content\n","\n","        # Log the model's response\n","        logging.debug(\"Model's response:\")\n","        logging.debug(message_content)\n","\n","        # Append the model's response to the chat history\n","        chat_history.append({\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": message_content})\n","\n","        return message_content\n","    except Exception as e:\n","        logging.error(f\"An error occurred: {str(e)}\")\n","        return f\"An error occurred: {str(e)}\"\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(chat_history)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Rn5vEXrcdNaf","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714962464186,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":160,"user":{"displayName":"Juan Fernando Lavieri Goiri","userId":"07985416332613908951"}},"outputId":"d6ea25f8-a137-4f62-f55c-e5725ebd387e"},"execution_count":96,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":97,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":648},"id":"TFlBvCRCRs_r","outputId":"f757b898-00c6-4676-dd9b-107fa1f113d0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714962468898,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1896,"user":{"displayName":"Juan Fernando Lavieri Goiri","userId":"07985416332613908951"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Setting queue=True in a Colab notebook requires sharing enabled.
